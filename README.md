TASK-8
DOCKERIZED WEB-APP ON THE AWS
I containerized a simple Python Flask web application using Docker and deployed it on AWS EC2 and ECS. 
I installed the AWS CLI on my EC2 instance, created a Docker image,
and pushed it to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).
Then, I created an ECS Task Definition and launched an ECS Service to run the containerized app.
The application was publicly accessible via the ECS service URL, 
and I verified it was running successfully. 
This task gave hands-on experience with containerization, 
cloud-native deployment, and AWS container services.
